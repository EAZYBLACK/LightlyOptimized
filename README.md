# ü™∂LightlyOptimized ‚Ä¢ Modpack
This is a simple and lightweight modpack, allowing you to optimize and run Minecraft on old or low-end computers without lag! With the support of shaders and a supply of optimization, it satisfies RAM Usage and CPU, typically by lowering them, boosting the FPS substantially. This is highly-configurable, flexible, and seamless.

It is also satisfactory to use RTX shaders on high-end computers. The purpose of the modpack is to bring a spotlight on its appealing appearance, balancing its performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Information
If you want the leaves to look like other modpacks, disable Cull Leaves pack.
Cull Leaves make it look like OptiFine Smart Leaves.
This modpack also has MoreCulling so disabling cull leaves will enable this.
Both mods have same performance just different look.

## ‚ùìWhy this and not optifine
Optifine has got very outdated tweaks and it breaks with some modern mods. Also it doesnt improve frame rate much in modern computers.
